# Telco-Customer-Churn

For all companies, especially telecom companies, it is key to attract new customers and avoid contract terminations to keep their base users growing and therefore grow their revenues. It is important to understand reasons behind customer churn and try to predict the churn before it happens. So it allows the companies to take counter measure such as discounts, special offers or other gratifications to keep their customers. 

A churn analysis is a typical classification problem under supervised learning predicting whether a customer is going to terminate their contract in a specific time period (usually a month). 

We will use a sample dataset call Telco customer churn from IBM to demonstrate how churn analysis works.
